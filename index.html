		My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br>
		found out he was going to die. That it was going to happen<br>
		soon. That it was real. Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br>
		Things I hadn't thought about for a long time. I guess I kind<br>
		of took him for granted or something. I mean, our parents are<br>
		just always there. You expect them to always be bugging you<br>
		to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br>
		try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br>
		day. And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br>
		"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br>
		crazy. I don't feel that way now. Everything's different since<br>
		Dad got his diagnosis. Since I realized that one day in the<br>
		near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.</p>
		<p class="small-copy yellow justify">
		Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that<br>
		question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br>
		sible. One day he won't be here to ask. Now I feel lucky when I hear<br>
		his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br>
		ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.</p>

		My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br>
		I mean, super brainiac annoying. He knows the most random stuff. Like<br>
		how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br>
		And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br>
		takes up about 9% more space. Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br>
		into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br>
		will go down. He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br>
		doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br>
		I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is. He likes to cook<br>
		because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br>
		cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br>
		goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br>
		He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br>
		hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br>
		(Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br>
		shoes he always wears). Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br>
		Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br>
		The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br>
		and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br>
		how he is at home and at school. I only just figured out what a good qual-<br>
		ity	that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br>
		made me brave, too when I was younger. Whether I wanted to be or not.<br>
		Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br>
		my dad being a teacher there I was different. I realize two things now.<br>
		First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br>
		And two, he's the right dad for me. I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br>
		cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br>
		lot of other dads I've met. They'd be disappointed because they're into<br>
		sports or whatever. I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br>
		wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br>
		makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br>
		about what the kids at school say anymore. The bottom line is he's a good<br>
		teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br>
		cares. After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br>
		best. I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br>
		for a long time. For him, for his students, and for me and my family.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		It's been a really tough time in our family since my dad got cancer. Not<br>
		that there's ever a good time for something as awful and as scary as that,<br>
		but it was sure a bad time for us. My mom was pregnant with what she calls<br>
		a surprise baby (who is now Holly and even though she's a newborn baby she's<br>
		actually cute) and my dad had an extra job after school to try to help pay<br>
		all the regular bills. And that was before he got his diagnosis. We don't<br>
		have a lot of money but we were doing okay until all the medical bills. And<br>
		my dad is pretty proud - okay, really proud - and doesn't want to take char-<br>
		ity. That's why I'm doing this. Not because I want to make him mad or<br>
		upset, but because I want him to have a fighting chance no matter what.</p>
		<p class="small-copy white">
		One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a<br>
		regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't<br>
		take insurance. I think that's wrong. I mean, one of the big reasons why<br>
		my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he<br>
		didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my<br>
		dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself. But we want him<br>
		around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as<br>
		possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life. And we<br>
		can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with<br>
		him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad. I want her to<br>
		know him for herself.</p>
